-- From exercises of Real World Haskell Chapter 03
-- Calulate the convex hull of a set of points
--
-- 10. Consider three two-dimensional points, a, b, and c. If we look at the
-- angle formed
-- by the line segment from a to b and the line segment from b to c, it turns
-- left, turns
-- right, or forms a straight line. Define a Direction data type that lets you
-- represent
-- these possibilities.
--
-- 11. Write a function that calculates the turn made by three two-dimensional
-- points
-- and returns a Direction .
--
-- 12. Define a function that takes a list of two-dimensional points and
-- computes the
-- direction of each successive triple. Given a list of points [a,b,c,d,e] , it
-- should
-- begin by computing the turn made by [a,b,c] , then the turn made by [b,c,d] ,
-- then [c,d,e] . Your function should return a list of Direction .
--
-- 13. Using the code from the preceding three exercises, implement Grahamâ€™s
-- scan al-
-- gorithm for the convex hull of a set of 2D points. You can find good
-- description
-- of what a convex hull (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) is, and how
-- the
-- Graham scan algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan) should work,
-- on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/).
